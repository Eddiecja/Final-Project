                            <p>My name is Eduardo Ceja and I am a graduate student from the University of Florida. I'm pursuing my master's in mass communication with a specialization in digital strategy. Before beginning my masters, I completed my bachelor's in cinema & television arts with a specialization in media management and televsion production from California State University, Northridge.</p>

                            <p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and I've always had a desire to create content. This is why I pursued a bachelor's degree in Cinema & Television Arts to gain a better understanding of the industry. I decided to continue my education and pursue my master's degree because I was always hungry for more knowledge to supplement my skills and expertise. I chose to pursue the online M.A.M.C. program at UF because I want to hone my technical digital marketing skills to supplement the broader concepts I learned as an undergrad.</p>

                            <p>I received a bachelor's degree in cinema and television arts from California State University, Northridge in 2020, with a focus on television production and media management. In order to focus on myself, I decided to take a year off from school before applying to UF's master's program. I currently work for an aerospace company as a Document Control Analyst.</p>
                            
                            <p>I enjoy going out to eat with my family, and we especially enjoy visiting restaurants that we find on TikTok. When I'm not stuffing my face with food, I'm binge-watching Netflix shows, going on hikes, camping, or hanging out with friends.</p>
